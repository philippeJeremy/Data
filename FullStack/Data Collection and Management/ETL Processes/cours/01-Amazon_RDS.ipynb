    "In your *Data Lake*, all the data you have been collecting is stored, but then you will probably want to use it to extract valuable information and insight. One to do this is creating a database. A database is a computer or a collection of computer that can access structured data, and is able to run programs that executes operations on your data and gives you the results. In this course you will learn: \n",

    "As its name suggests, Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service) is a service that handles databases. üëç The cool features are that AWS will provide an easy set up and flexibility. With RDS, you will be able to create a database instance within minutes and scale it up or down very easily! \n",

    "|Database Engine| This refers to the above table. Databases have engine types such as MySQL, PostgreSQL,... RDBMS or Engine Type are two interchangeable words, it's the piece of sofware that makes the DB work|\n",
    "|DB Instance Class| This refers to the computing power needed for your database. You'll setup CPU, Memory Capacity, just like for an EC2 Instance (remember that a RDBMS like any software has to run on some physical machine)|\n",
    "|Multi AZ| You might want to setup High Availability zones for your instance to prevent any failure. This is what Multi-AZ does|\n",
    "|Primary Host| It's a node that handles queries on your DB (The machine that will interpret your instructions - e.g. SQL statements - and transfer them to the machine(s) that will work on your data)|\n",
    "|Read Replicas| It's a replica of your DB that handles only READ queries. This offloads your Primary Host|\n",
    "|Secondary Host| A copy of your Primary Host that is here to prevent failures|"
