    "\n",
    "S3 stands for Simple Storage Service and it is a way to upload and store files within AWS. Just like a Google Drive, you can upload any file you want from 0 Bytes to 5TB.\n",
    "S3 is often reffered as a **Data Lake** type of service, a Data Lake lets you store your data, regardless of its nature, this is the place where a company or institution will store all the data it is capturing before it decides to use it further or not.\n",

    "\n",
    "Files are stored in what is called a **Bucket**. A Bucket is just a folder where your files will be stored. \n",

    "The only thing you need to remember is that each bucket accross the world has a **unique name.** For example, a typical URL to access an S3 Bucket is like this:\n",

    "|S3 - Infrequently Accessed|You will use this version when your bucket won't be accessed many times during the day. This is a cheaper version of S3|\n",
    "|S3 One Zone - Infrequently Accessed|Same as above but in addition, your bucket doesn't need to have multi-zone availability. Meaning your bucket will be accessed from the same region in the world. This is the cheapest option available when you still need to access data| \n",
    "|S3 - Glacier| Glacier is used for data archiving. This is the cheapest version in terms of storage but you won't be able to retrieve your data easily|\n",
    "|S3 - Intelligent Tiering| This is the newest product of AWS that uses Machine Learning to intelligently adapt costs according to your usage|\n",
