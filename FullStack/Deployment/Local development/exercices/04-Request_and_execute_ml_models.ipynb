    "# Request and execute an ML model 🚀\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "We want know to use our new scripting skills to be able to use Machine Learning models in production. For this exercise, let's assume that a Data Science team has built a Machine Learning algorithm that is able to  **predict californian housing prices** 😉.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Now our objective will be to use this model to predict real data** 🎯\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the Data Science teams has stored the model into an S3 Bucket. Here is the info:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `BUCKET_NAME=\"full-stack-assets\"`\n",
    "* `KEY=\"Deployment/house_prices_model.joblib\"`\n",
    "* `OBJECT_URL=\"https://full-stack-assets.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/Deployment/house_prices_model.joblib\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need this information later. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also, another development team built an [API](https://www.jedha.co/blog/api-definition-utilite) that is able to fetch new data from *californian housing*. This API has been hosted here:\n",
    "\n",
    "* https://house-prices-simple-api.herokuapp.com/\n",
    "\n",
    "Check out the url and read documentation 📰 to understand it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now our goal will be to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Query data from the API \n",
    "* Import and use the Machine Learning model to make predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "Your script should output something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Loading model...\n",
    "model loaded!\n",
    "\n",
    "Using model to make prediction...\n",
    "According to our model, this house should cost: 4.911525723809524\n",
    "\n",
    "Checking accuracy...\n",
    "House actual price is: 4.908\n",
    "Our model is 0.003525723809523207 away from the truth!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "🏁 To start off, go into your terminal and run: \n",
    "\n",
    "`docker run -it -v \"$(pwd):/home/app\" jedha/house-prices-image -q`\n",
    "> 👋 if you're running on Windows, replace `pwd` by `%cd%`\n",
    "\n",
    "This will run a *\"mini computer\"* within your machine with all the required installations. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now here are some hints 🧩 that you can use to succeed: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a python file, like `app.py`. \n",
    "2. Run your script using `python app.py` whenever you want to test your code.\n",
    "3. You might need to use `requests`, `boto3`, `joblib` as libraries. Check out their respective documentation to see what they do and how you can leverage them. \n",
    "4. You will need to read actual files. To do so, you can use the `with open(FILENAME, \"PERMISSIONS\")` syntax. Check out [this link](https://www.pythonforbeginners.com/files/with-statement-in-python) that will give you more info.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "👋 Once you are done, you can simply get out of this container by executing the following command:\n",
    "* `exit`\n",
    "* Finally run:\n",
    "    * `docker rm $(docker ps -aq); docker rmi $(docker image ls -q)`"
