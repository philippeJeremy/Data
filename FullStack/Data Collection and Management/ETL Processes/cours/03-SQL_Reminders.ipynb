    "A database is a collection of structured information stored in a computer's memory or hard disk. There are several types of databases. In this course, we will focus on relational databases, which are the most popular in business. Just like Excel, a relational database consists of 2-dimensional tables made up of rows and columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, a database is accessed via a DBMS (Database Management System). This is an interface that allows you to access, add, modify and secure data on your server.\n",

    "### Table \n",
    "\n",
    "Each table (or relation) consists of rows and columns. Each column defines the type of data you have, while the rows represent each entry (data) in your table.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Schema\n",
    "\n",
    "A database does not have only one table, that's why we have what is called a Schema. It is the set formed by the different tables and the relationships between each of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lines\n",
    "\n",
    "Also called record, a line represents a specific instance of your table. For example, each of your customers would be a row in your company's Customer table.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Columns\n",
    "\n",
    "Also called field, the columns represents the structure of your database. Each column has a name and stores information of a specific type. For example, one column will represent the names of your customers while another will represent the revenue generated by each customer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a list of the different types of data:\n",
    "\n",
    "- INTEGER, positive or negative integers\n",
    "- TEXT, string\n",
    "- DATE, date formatted as follows : YYYY - MM - DD \n",
    "- REAL/FLOAT, decimal number\n",
    "- NULL, represents values that are either unknown or missing. Warning 0 is not NULL."
