    "Before we start, we need to understand what a server is. Think of a server as a computer without any pre-configuration. When you create a server on AWS or any cloud platform, you will simply have an operating system installed but without any interface, package, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will therefore have to make the necessary installations yourself so that your application can run. Among the most popular OS (operating system) you have:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Ubuntu (Linux)\n",
    "* Windows\n",
    "\n",
    "Each time you will have to specify the type of OS you want on your server. This will then determine how you will need to install your packages on it."

    "Now, if you want to deploy an application, you need to setup your server so that it has:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The right OS \n",
    "* The right runtime (Python, NodeJS etc.)\n",
    "* The right dependencies \n",
    "* All the potential environment variables \n",
    "* and so on... \n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, it can be a hassle to have to do everything yourself. Heroku does all the heavy lifting for you! That is why it is so powerful! \n",
    "\n",
    "### How does it work? \n",
    "\n",
    "This is the best part of Heroku, all you need to remember are basic `git` commands to push an application to production. Basically, you will do: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. A classic commit\n",
    "2. A push to a heroku branch \n",
    "3. That's it! ü§ó\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setup your account \n",
    "\n",
    "Before we learn how to deploy an app, we need to create an account and login to it in the console. Here is the process: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a <a href=\"https://signup.heroku.com/login\" target=\"_blank\">Heroku account</a>.\n",
    "2. Open a console and install heroku:\n",
    "    * MacOS: run `brew tap heroku/brew && brew install heroku`.\n",
    "    * Windows 64 Bits: <a href=\"https://cli-assets.heroku.com/heroku-x64.exe\" target=\"_blank\">Download the installer</a>.\n",
    "    * Windows 32 Bits: <a href=\"https://cli-assets.heroku.com/heroku-x86.exe\" target=\"_blank\">Download the installer</a>.\n",
    "    * Ubuntu: run `sudo snap install --classic heroku`.\n",
    "    * If all the above methods don't suit you, check out their documentation: <a href=\"https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.\n",
    "3. To check if Heroku has been installed, simply run: `heroku --version`. You should see an output like this: \n",
    "\n",
    "```shell \n",
    "heroku/7.42.1 darwin-x64 node-v12.16.2\n",

    "To deploy your app, we will be using **Docker** with Heroku. You will see that the process is fairly simple.\n",
    "\n",
    "> üëã Quick disclaimer: You **don't have** to deploy Heroku using Docker. We chose to teach you that way since it's the most standard and easy way to do so. It will also be extremely useful for you to know how to setup Docker container for deployment. However you can also deploy applications without Docker. If you want to know how to do it, simply checkout our online course: [Deploying your app with Heroku](https://app.jedha.co/track/deploying-your-app-with-heroku)\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step-1**: Set your Dockerfile\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some specific configurations that you need to have on your `Dockerfile`: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Make sure that your host IP server within your container is: `0.0.0.0` \n",
    "\n",
    "In our app for example, check out `.streamlit/config.toml` file, you will see:\n",
    "\n",
    "```toml\n",
    "[browser]\n",
    "serverAddress = '0.0.0.0' # üëà This is what makes our host running in IP 0.0.0.0\n",

    "\n",
    "[theme]\n",
    "base=\"dark\"\n",
    "primaryColor=\"#4be8e0\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Replace default port by an environment variable called `$PORT`\n",
    "\n",
    "Heroku will give *HTTP* and *HTTPS* access to your app, which are two different ports. Therefore you need to make sure that heroku can configure that by itself. Checkout our `Dockerfile`\n",
    "\n",
    "```Dockerfile \n",
    "FROM continuumio/miniconda3\n",
    "\n",
    "WORKDIR /home/app\n",

    "* **Make sure you setup your environment variables correctly**\n",

    "Another point that can make your app crash is that you didn't setup your environment variables. Make sure you have them setup on your Docker container and in your Heroku app: *Settings > Reveal Config Vars*\n",

    "* **Don't try to run heroku within your Docker container**\n",

    "Instead, follow these steps: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Force image creation with `amd64` architecture with the following command: \n",
    "* `docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64 -t YOUR_IMAGE_NAME`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Then rename your image with heroku registry name: \n",
    "* `docker tag YOUR_IMAGE_NAME registry.heroku.com/YOUR_APP_NAME/web`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Push your image to heroku: \n",
    "* `docker push registry.heroku.com/YOUR_APP_NAME/web`\n",
    "\n",
    "Then you can follow the \"normal\" steps \n",
    "\n",
