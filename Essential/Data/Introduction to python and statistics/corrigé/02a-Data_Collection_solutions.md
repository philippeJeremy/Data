# Collecting Data

We have three different problems.


1. Google hired you because they are developing their new driverless cars. However, they would like to know if there is a real business opportunity and if their customers are willing to be driven by a robot. To help you, Google has launched an unbiased online questionnaire. In order to optimize costs, Google did not send its questionnaire to all its customers but to all customers in 10 different cities taken at random.
    1. What type of study are we dealing with? (Observational / Experimental / Transversal / Longitudinal)
    2. What type of sampling did Google use? (Stratified Sampling / Convenience Sampling / Cluster Sampling / Simple Random Sampling)

Answer: Observational and Transversal because the questionnaire is NOT BIASED, that is to say that we experiment nothing on the subjects. We just observe them. The sampling method is Cluster Sampling because we randomly took 10 cities and studied all of the customers in those cities.

2. Grammarly (a startup whose goal is to improve the use of English) has just launched a new product to help people stop making spelling mistakes when they write an email. They would like to launch an experiment to find out whether or not their new product actually helps improve grammar. The team would like to do this experiment on foreign people in San Francisco. After further research, Grammarly discovered that the foreign population of SF is 10% French, 10% Italian, 5% German, 20% Indian, 15% Chinese, 5% Japanese, 5% Taiwanese, 5% South African, 5% Moroccan, 15% Mexican, 5% Brazilian. They have created a sample of people who meet exactly these criteria. The experiment will last 6 months.
    3. What type of study are we dealing with? (Observational / Experimental / Transversal / Longitudinal)
    4. What type of sampling did Grammarly use? (Stratified Sampling / Convenience Sampling / Cluster Sampling / Simple Random Sampling)


Answer: Experimental & Longitudinal because customers will test Grammarly so they receive a “treatment” to see whether their English skills have improved or not. And, since we are doing the experiment over 6 months, it has to be longitudinal. The sampling method is Stratified Sampling because we have taken a sample which follows exactly the same proportion as the population. Be careful however, we consider that it is not possible to have dual nationality because otherwise the country variables are not mutually exclusive. You can explain it to your students.

3. Société Générale would like to have more customers opening bank accounts. They have thought of sending a burst of marketing emails to their potential customers. However, they would first like to test their email on a sub-group of individuals. The bank has little time because the email has to be sent to the database within 2 months maximum. The data team has simply chosen the people who are most likely to respond.
    5. What type of study are we dealing with? (Observational / Experimental / Transversal / Longitudinal)
    6. What type of sampling did Société Générale use? (Stratified sampling / Convenience Sampling / Cluster Sampling / Simple Random Sampling)


Answer: Observational & Transversal because we do not give “treatment” to our sample and we do this experiment only once in time. However, we have a Convenience Sampling because the Data team has chosen itself the people who will receive the email.
