    "When you are building application, it is not uncommon to use third-party applications like `aws` or any other paid API. These applications require a password or an API KEY that you should **never share** since it's quite sensitive data. For example, with AWS credentials, anyone could use your cloud services and hack them! \n",

    "### Docker cli \n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways to setup environment variables. One way is to use Docker like this: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "docker run \\\n",
    "-e ENV_1=\"ENV_1_VALUE\" \\\n",
    "-e ENV_2=\"ENV_2_VALUE \\\n",
    "IMAGE_NAME\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This code will store the value `\"ENV_1_VALUE\"` inside an environment variale called `ENV_1`, similarly it will store the value `\"ENV_2_VALUE\"` inside an environment variale called `ENV_2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that these environment variables will 'live' in your docker container and not on your local system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then in your dockerfile you may access these container specific environment variables like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "```dockerfile\n",
    "FROM python:3.9.9-alpine\n",
    "\n",
    "WORKDIR /home/app\n",
    "\n",
    "# Here we set up environment variables according to values that \n",
    "# will be passed to the container via the docker run command!\n",
    "ENV env_1 = $ENV_1\n",
    "ENV env_2 = $ENV_2\n",
    "\n",
    "COPY app.py app.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### `export` command \n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use the `export` command like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "`export ENV_1=\"ENV_1_VALUE\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "Then you can easily access this value like this: `echo $ENV_1` \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that if you use the export command in the terminal, it will setup this environment variable where your terminal is running, meaning if you are running your terminal on your local computer you may register environment variable to your computer, if the terminal is running inside a container then you may only register environment variables to your container.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `Dockerfile`\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the `ENV` instruction in your dockerfile \n",
    "\n",
    "```dockerfile\n",
    "FROM python:3.9-alpine\n",
    "\n",
    "WORKDIR /app\n",
    "\n",
    "COPY . .\n",
    "\n",
    "RUN echo \"Cookies and cheesecakes are my favorites\" > favorites_cakes.txt\n",
    "\n",
    "ENV MY_CAKE=\"Fondant au chocolat\"\n",
    "\n",
    "CMD python app.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then your app can access it like this: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python \n",
    "import os\n",
    "\n",
    "def main():\n",
    "    print(\"Cakes are the best!\")\n",
    "    with open(\"/app/favorites_cakes.txt\") as f:\n",
    "        print(f.read())\n",
    "    print(f\"And I like {os.environ['MY_CAKE']} too!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "    main()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This method is less secure than declaring your environment variable through the terminal because they are written in clear on your dockerfile. So typically if you wish someone else to be able to work on your app, you'll have to give them your Dockerfile with the values of the environment variables written on it, which may not be safe.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also note that the environment variables you declare directly on your dockerfile will only live in the container you are running using it, and nowhere else!"
