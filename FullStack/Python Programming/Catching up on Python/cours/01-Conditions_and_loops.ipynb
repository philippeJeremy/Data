    "## What you will learn in this course 🧐🧐\n",
    "\n",
    "During this first course of our long journey in Data Science, we will review the fundamentals of Python and especially the concepts of loops and conditions. The goal is to give you a solid foundation to move forward more quickly in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is what we will cover:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*   What is an IDE\n",
    "*   What is a console and its main controls?\n",
    "*   Making conditions\n",
    "*   Make a FOR loop\n",
    "*   Make a WHILE loop\n",
    "\n",
    "## Developer's Toolkit\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strolling through your folders with the terminal\n",
    "\n",
    "Very often you will have to tell your console where to find the folders and files you are going to run. That's why you will need to know the main commands that allow you to perform these tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "WARNING: The commands are sometimes not the same between MAC and PC. You will have to pay attention to this depending on the machine you are going to work on. We are using Mac for writing this course but we will also put the commands for PC.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### `ls` (or `dir` on Windows)\n",
    "\n",
    "This command is used to list everything in the folder you are in. \n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "MacBook-Air-de-Antoine-2: ONE_FOLDER antoinekrajnc$ ls\n",
    ">>>> files_1.py files_2.py files_3.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "NB : For Windows, this command is not called `ls` but `dir`\n",
    "\n",
    "That's it, this covers the two main commands you need to know in your console. Now let's look at how we can execute code in our console.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### `cd`\n",
    "\n",
    "This command is to change the folder you are in. \n",
    "Here is an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "$ cd Desktop\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we go directly to the _Desktop_ folder on our computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "With `cd` and `ls`, you can walk through all your filesystem in the terminal. We will teach you more terminal commands later.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The REPL\n",
    "\n",
    "We can execute code on our console via our REPL (Read Evaluate Print Loop). To access it, just write the `python` command on your console:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "$ python\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You will enter in the REPL. This tool is very handy for testing raw code and for doing quick tests. Let's write a simple program:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "Print(\"Hello World !\")\n",
    ">>> Hello World !\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a simple program in our REPL that allows us to write _Hello World_ in our console.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the REPL has one drawback, it's that you can't change the code easily, which is not convenient because the slightest mistake will require you to rewrite all the code from scratch, which is very frustrating when you've already written 9-10 lines of code. That's why we use what we call a code editor.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### A code editor\n",
    "\n",
    "A text editor is where you'll put all your script. You have different types of text editors like Sublime, Pycharm or Notepad++. If you already have a favorite editor, use the one you like. Otherwise, we advise you Atom or Sublime which are generalist and good or Pycharm which is specialized for Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is an IDE ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Very often, instead of using the console and the text editor separately, developers prefer to use what is called an IDE or Integrated Development Environment. They allow you to bring your console and text editor (and sometimes more features) together in a graphical user interface that will help you code more easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Data Science, the most commonly used IDEs are Spyder and Jupyter. There is an equivalent of Jupyter installed in a Cloud: [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb#recent=true).\n",
    "Google Colaboratory has all the advantages of a Jupyter Notebook without you having to install anything locally on your machine !\n",
    "\n",
    "During this program, we will work on a J.U.L.I.E. workspace in which Jupyter and all the tools needed to do Data Science are installed. You will be able to do all the exercises proposed during the course, whatever your operating system (Mac, Windows, Linux), without having to worry about prior installations. The file you are reading (with the .ipynb extension) is in fact a Jupyter notebook."
