    "Volumes are a way to decouple data from your container. It has a lot of interesting usecases. For example, you might want to seperate source files from your container so that you can reuse them later on after you have stopped your container. Another example is to be able to write code on your local machine that you can modify without having to rebuild your image or rerun your container. In this course, we will learn:\n",

    "## What is a volume \n",
    "\n",
    "### Example of volumes usecase\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand the purpose of using volumes, let's take an example. Imagine that you have a folder called `app` that is organized like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "├── Dockerfile\n",
    "└── app.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Within your `app.py` is a very simple script:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python \n",
    "# Within your app.py\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Hello world from Jedha!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And within your `Dockerfile`: \n",
    "\n",
    "```Dockerfile\n",
    "# Within your Dockerfile \n",
    "FROM python:3.9.9-alpine\n",
    "\n",
    "WORKDIR /home/app\n",
    "\n",
    "COPY app.py app.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now build your image: \n",
    "\n",
    "`docker build . -t jedha/volumes_demo`\n",
    "\n",
    "and run your container using this command:\n",
    "\n",
    "`docker run -it jedha/volumes_demo sh`\n",
    "\n",
    "Within your container, try to run `app.py` by running `python app.py` you should see the following output: `Hello world from Jedha!`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, opened VSCode and try to modify the code in `app.py` and rerun `python app.py` you should still see: `Hello world from Jedha!` 🤔. \n",
    "\n",
    "With this code, this only way you could reflect your changes would be to stop your container, build a new image and then rerun your container. Which is quite tedious... \n",
    "\n",
    "So how could we solve that problem? 🥁 ...\n",
    "\n",
    "With **volumes**!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Volumes definition \n",
    "\n",
    "A volume is a way to persist data outside of a container. This works perfectly with code for example. \n",
    "\n",
    "![snap](https://full-stack-assets.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/Deployment/Volumes.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above diagram for example, you can have one volume applied to several containers. Eventhough a container is stopped or removed, the **volume will persist** which is what is great about it! \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, there are several types of volumes: \n",
    "\n",
    "* `bind mounts`\n",
    "* `volumes` \n",
    "* `tmpfs mounts`\n",
    "* `named pipes`\n",
    "\n",
    "With `bind mounts` you will use it to be able to modify code in a running container. You will need to specify the absolute path of where your data is living within your host machine. That is why it is perfect for this usecase\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, `volumes` are more of general use. You will create it using `docker volumes create VOLUME_NAME` and then attach it to your container. This is perfect when you want to have persisting data like `.csv` files. \n",
    "\n",
    "The other two are definitely less used so we won't develop them in this course. Feel free to read more here though: https://docs.docker.com/storage/"
