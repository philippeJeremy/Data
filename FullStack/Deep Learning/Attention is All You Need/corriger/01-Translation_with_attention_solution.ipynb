We will try to implement this type of model for our translator. \n","\n","### Data import \n","\n","You will have the same `.txt` file containing a sentence with its translation separated by a tab (`\\t`). You will have to import this data and read it via `pandas`.\n","\n","Your data can be found on this link: https://go.aws/38ECHUB\n","\n","### Preprocessing \n","\n","The whole purpose of your preprocessing is to express your (French) entry sentence in a sequence of clues.\n","\n","i.e. :\n","\n","* je suis heureux---> `[123, 21, 34, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n","\n","This gives a *shape* -> `(batch_size, max_len_of_a_sentence)`.\n","\n","The zeros correspond to what are called [*padded_sequences*](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/preprocessing/sequence/pad_sequences) which allow all word sequences to have the same length across a set of sequences (mandatory for your algorithm). \n","\n","You will run the same preprocessing on the target sequences, and add a `<start>` token at the beginning of each sequence.\n","\n","* `<start>` I am happy ---> `[1, 43, 2, 42, 0, 0]`\n","\n","### Modeling \n","\n","For modeling, you will need to set up layers of attention. You'll need to: \n","\n","* Create an `Encoder` class that inherits from `tf.keras.Model`.\n","* Create a Bahdanau Attention Layer that will be a class that inherits `tf.keras.layers.Layer`\n","* Finally create a `Decoder` class that inherits from `tf.keras.Model`.\n","\n","\n","You will need to create your own cost function as well as your own training loop. \n","\n","\n","### Tips \n","\n","Don't take the whole dataset at the beginning for your experiments, just take 5000 or even 3000 sentences.
